A simple REST API with geolocation searching to test the Play! Framework
=====================================

Install Play! and run "play test" to run the unit tests of this project.

The application itself cannot be run locally because it requires a remote
database connection to the DB hosted on openshift, which is fine, but I
would not like to disclose the credentials.

To open the project in eclipse, run "play eclipse" from this directory and then import it as an existing project in eclipse.
To open it with IntelliJ, run "play idea" from this directory and open the project in IntelliJ.
